    <h3><p>Juno is a take on the highly popular card game, 'Uno', played by millions around the globe.</p> 
       <p>This game is played by matching and then discarding the cards in one’s hand till none are left.</p>
       <p>Here are the rules of Juno.</p></h3>
       <br></br>
    <h1>Set Up</h1>
    <h3><p>The game is for 2 players. Each player starts with seven cards. One card will be placed face up as the 'matcher' card.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h1>Game Play</h1>
    <p>You will take your turn first and the computer will go second. Each player views their cards and tries to match the matcher card. You have to match either by number or color. For instance, if the matcher card is a red card that is an 8, you have to play either a red card or a card with an 8 on it.</p></h3>
    <h3><p>If you have no matches, you must draw a card. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, keep the card, and the game moves on to the computer's turn.</p></h3>
    <h3><p>Take note that you can only put down one card at a time!</p></h3>
    <h3><p>Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins over again.</p></h3>
