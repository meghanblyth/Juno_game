## 👀 Overview

A simple Uno Game made in Javascript (hence the name 'Juno'!) created for our final project at the Makers Academy. Players take turns matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck, either by color or number. 'Special' cards deliver extra functions to help you defeat your opponent - these include skips, reverses, and color-changing wild cards.
